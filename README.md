# LearnAI2025
For School students, the usage of AI should become a common / routine task. To enable students to get familar with AI , I have a put a 14 day program to cover the basic to advance. The spectrum starts with basic LLM to Agentic AI
Artificial Intelligence in 2025 isn’t just a buzzword—it’s the backbone of modern problem-solving, creativity, and decision-making across industries. From autonomous agents and multimodal systems to explainable graph-based reasoning and human-in-the-loop workflows, AI is evolving into a collaborative partner, not just a tool. 

This 14-day program is your gateway into that future. 

🌟 What You’ll Learn 

How LLMs think: Understand the architecture, tuning, and safety behind today’s most powerful language models. 

How agents act: Build intelligent systems that reason, retrieve, and adapt across contexts. 

How workflows scale: Design modular, tool-using agents that integrate with APIs, databases, and human oversight. 

How AI becomes explainable: Use graph databases, memory, and post-processing to make AI outputs transparent and reliable. 

How to deploy responsibly: Learn to fine-tune, guardrail, and host AI systems with real-world constraints. 

🧠 What You’ll Build 

Chatbots, research assistants, and context-aware agents 

Retrieval-augmented systems and multimodal applications 

Safe, instruction-following models with human supervision 

Scalable deployments and explainable AI dashboards 

🎯 What You’ll Walk Away With 

A working knowledge of modern AI systems 

Reusable code, templates, and workflows 

A portfolio of mini-projects grounded in real-world use cases 

The confidence to design, deploy, and collaborate with AI—ethically and effectively
